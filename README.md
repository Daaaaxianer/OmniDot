# OmniDot
A multi-scale dot plot visualization tool for comparative genomics. Analyze alignments from genomic fragments and chromosomes down to intragenic micro-structures.

**OmniDot**
 is a comprehensive dot plot visualization tool designed for multi-scale comparative genomics.

Traditional tools often struggle to bridge the gap between whole-genome synteny and sequence-level details. OmniDot is built to provide a unified visualization experience across all genomic dimensions:

* **Chromosomal Level**
: Visualize macro-synteny and large-scale structural variations between genomes.
* **Fragment Level**: efficiently handle and visualize unplaced **genomic fragments (scaffolds/contigs)**
 to assist in assembly validation.
* **Intragenic Level**: Zoom into the micro-scale to reveal **intragenic**
 alignments, exon/intron boundaries, and local repeats.

From broad evolutionary patterns to precise gene-level architecture, OmniDot helps you see the whole picture.
